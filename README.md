# A reusable AI-agent organization for FPGA programs

This repository is a cloned shell, not a finished project. It contains a
complete agent organization for running an FPGA program — charters, an
operating protocol, commit-enforcement machinery, spawn launchers, and seeded
journals — with the project itself left as an explicit slot. A human sponsor
and an orchestrator session fill that slot at the G0 intake, and the org then
designs, verifies, validates, documents, and audits the program around it.
It also harvests lessons at every gate: they land in your organization's
own copy of this shell automatically, and are offered onward to the
canonical shell with one yes/no from you, default yes
([docs/FEDERATION.md](docs/FEDERATION.md)).
The org design and its enforcement machinery were distilled from the
[agentic-fpga program](https://github.com/renatom11/agentic-fpga), where they
were proven in operation.

## The project

Filled at G0 intake — see [BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md). The table below is the
canonical statement of scope, phases, and success criteria (PROTOCOL §1);
it changes only by sponsor decision (E2).

| Phase | Scope | Success criteria |
|---|---|---|
| _—_ | _recorded at G0 intake_ | _recorded at G0 intake_ |

## The org

**Start at [`ORG_CHART.md`](ORG_CHART.md).** Every agent has a
version-controlled charter in [`agents/charters/`](agents/charters/) defining
its responsibilities, interfaces, definition of done, evaluation criteria, and
escalation rules. Shared rules live in
[`agents/PROTOCOL.md`](agents/PROTOCOL.md). Live program state is in
[`tasks/BOARD.md`](tasks/BOARD.md).

## The journaling guarantee

Every agent keeps an **append-only journal**
(`agents/journals/claude_<name>_agent.md`, a volume chain per PROTOCOL §4.3)
and every commit couples one agent's work with that agent's journal entry
explaining it — mechanically enforced by
[`scripts/agent_commit.sh`](scripts/agent_commit.sh) and re-verified over
every pushed range by CI
([`.github/workflows/journal-check.yml`](.github/workflows/journal-check.yml)).

Consequences you can rely on:

- `git diff A..B` — for *any* two commits — shows both what changed and the
  reasoning that produced it, side by side in the same diff.
- `git log --grep 'Agent: rtl_lead'` reconstructs any one agent's entire
  thread of work.
- Journal history cannot be quietly rewritten: the append-only property is
  re-checked over the FULL history on every push (an incremental range check
  cannot detect a rewrite), backstopped by branch protection on `main` and the
  working branch (a one-time sponsor setup, G0 checklist item), and journal
  `Evidence` sections are falsifiable — the auditor re-executes them at the
  recorded SHA.

Run the enforcement self-test: `bash scripts/test_protocol.sh`.

## Getting started

Three levels, two moves of yours
([docs/FEDERATION.md](docs/FEDERATION.md) §0):

**Found your organization — once.** Fork this repository (or clone it and
push to a new repo of your own). That copy is your **org generic**: your
team's own ecosystem, where lessons from all your projects accumulate. It
runs no project itself. Do **not** use GitHub's "Use this template"
button: it squashes history into a single commit, and this repository's
commit history is load-bearing — the journal-check CI verifies the whole
chain, and a squashed history fails it by design. (A solo run of a single
project may treat the project copy below as both levels: it then holds
the org-generic role for federation — its upstream line stays the
canonical shell, its lessons land in itself. If a second project ever
becomes likely, found the real org generic first: graduation later means
forking this shell fresh and landing the solo copy's accumulated lessons
into it through the org-fence pipeline before project 2 forks.)

**To start each project:**

1. **Fork your org generic** (same no-template-button rule) — one fork
   per project. It boots with everything your organization has learned:
   the accumulated core lessons and the domain packs your intake
   declares. Inheritance is fixed at the fork point — a running project
   does not refresh from the org generic mid-flight; lessons landed by
   sibling projects reach it only through its own next fork, by design.
2. Open a Claude Code session on your fork, on any machine, and say:
   *"Read CLAUDE.md — you are this repository's orchestrator. Walk me
   through G0."*
3. Give it your material: paste prose, and/or drop files — docs about
   what you're building, rough requirement drafts, reference specs,
   datasheets — into an `intake/` directory. The org digests everything
   into one proposal for your signature ([BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md)
   Section B, Path B); your resources then remain its project reference
   material.
4. Do the two sponsor-only duties when the checklist reaches them:
   ratify the charters and set branch protection (a GitHub settings
   action).

The sponsor and the fresh orchestrator session walk G0 together;
[BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md) is the script. G0 covers: org ratification (or
amendment before ratification), branch protection on `main` and the working
branch, a green enforcement self-test, and the project intake that fills the
phase table above and records the toolchain candidates, external references,
and their license classes. Until the intake is recorded on
[`tasks/BOARD.md`](tasks/BOARD.md), the orchestrator spawns no agent.
