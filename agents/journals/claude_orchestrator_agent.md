## [J-orchestrator-0001] 2026-08-03T18:40:00Z | task:none | C1 - the enforcement core, seeded from the agentic-fpga program

### Trigger
Sponsor decision (2026-08-03): package the agentic-fpga program's
proven methodology as this reusable, toolchain-agnostic shell.
This is the first commit; the seeding session is the agentic-fpga
orchestrator, acting here as this repository's first orchestrator.

### Inputs
- Source: https://github.com/renatom11/agentic-fpga at pinned SHA
  1799e10a37f19059ac3337982af4b6d035e14d0c (all reads at the pin;
  the source working tree carried concurrent in-flight edits).
- The source's PROTOCOL v1 (ratified at its G0, never amended in
  place until its first amendment landed the seal rule), its four
  enforcement scripts, and its journal-check workflow.

### Reasoning
- The R1-R9 engine ports near-verbatim: the commit and CI scripts
  carried no project hardcoding; the two genuine slots were the
  agent roster and the path-lane table, both now generic (rtl/**,
  test/**, tools/**, docs/reports/{dv,audit}/**).
- Two hardenings the source learned by incident are built in from
  birth rather than inherited as debt: R10 journal volume chains
  (the source's 1 MB journal incident; freeze-in-place /
  fork-forward with sha256 back-links, rotation supported from
  commit #1) and the R-SEAL-1 advisory check (the source's
  sealed-sweep-that-never-existed incident; WARN-SEAL, gating
  only under STRICT_SEALS=1, because no grep distinguishes
  quotation from assertion).
- PROTOCOL v2 folds the source's operationally-accreted rules
  into the constitution at birth - the source's own largest
  topology lesson was that its protocol froze while its rules
  accreted elsewhere. Mutation discipline is written as the
  source PRACTICED it (freeze-first sealed predictions, blinded
  no-stake seeder, throwaway never-merged branches), not as its
  v1 text described it.
- The project itself lives in README's intake-filled phase table;
  this protocol never names it, so intake never amends it.

### Actions
Wrote and staged the enforcement core; ran the self-test suite;
this commit is made through scripts/agent_commit.sh itself - the
history demonstrates the system from commit #1, as the source's
M0 did.

### Evidence
- bash scripts/test_protocol.sh: 38 passed, 0 failed (34
  scenarios: S1-S27 ported from the source, S28-S31 proving R10,
  S32-S34 proving WARN-SEAL), run by the committing session.
- bash -n clean on all four scripts.
- grep -riE 'hardcaml|ocaml|dune|opam|iverilog|xgmii|itch|
  moldudp|nasdaq|trading|renato' over the tree: no hits outside
  the single source-program reference URL in tasks/BOARD.md.

### Outcome
The shell can enforce its own constitution. Next commits: the org
surface (charters, launchers, org chart), the pre-adopted
constitution ADRs with provenance, the lessons record, playbooks
and templates, the bootstrap walkthrough, then the handoff to the
operating orchestrator session.

### Open-questions
- The advisory journal-rotation threshold here is 800000 bytes
  against the 1000000-byte blob gate; the source program is
  adopting a tighter soft/hard pair anchored to a measured
  rehydration degradation. Whether this shell tightens to match
  is a decision for its constitution ADR (ADR-0005, next
  commits) - rotation support exists here from birth either way.
